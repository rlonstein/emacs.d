;;; Commentary:

;; * Description

;; This package allows you to add entries to an embedded change log
;; like the one in this file.

;; * Installation

;; Add the following to your .emacs:
;; (autoload 'embedded-changelog-add-entry
;; "/path/to/embeddedchangelog.el" nil t)

;;; History:
;; 2002-03-07  Michele Bini  <mibin@libero.it>
;;
;;   * embeddedchangelog.el: File name renamed.
;;   (narrow-to-embedded-changelog): Documentation fixes.
;;   (embedded-changelog-buffer): New variable.
;;   (embedded-changelog-add-entry): Use an already existing change
;;   log buffer, if possible.
;;
;; 2002-02-27  Michele Bini  <mibin@libero.it>
;;
;;   * embedded-changelog.el (embedded-changelog-add-entry): Left
;;   margin set to 2.
;;   (embedded-changelog-write-file): Return true.  Use
;;   set-buffer-modified-p.  Ask about adding a Code section before
;;   adding an History one.
;;   (embedded-changelog-left-margin): New variable.
